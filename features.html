                <h1>NSX Type S</h1>
                <p> Hand-built by master technicians at the Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC) with a limited production of 350 units 
                    globally, the new NSX embodies the pinnacle of dynamic driving worthy of the Type S badge. While continuing to honor 
                    its lineage with meticulous engineering and striking design, the NSX Type S pushes the boundaries of possibility with 
                    more power and more sound for a more adrenaline-fueled drive.

            While it will certainly satiate your need for speed, the NSX can't outpace some key rivals such as the Audi R8 or the McLaren 570S. 
            In our testing, it still snapped off lightning-quick acceleration times and managed a 3.1-second run from zero to 60 mph. Its 
            electric-only Quiet mode, however, gives it something its rivals don't have: discretion.The NSX's hybrid-electric powertrain 
            combines a twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V-6 with three electric motors for a combined total of 573 horsepower. The V-6, the nine-speed 
            dual-clutch automatic transmission, and one of the electric motors work as a team to power the rear wheels. The other two electric
            motors operate independently to drive the front wheels, effectively giving the NSX all-wheel drive.

            The standard Acura/ELS Studio®20 Premium Audio System truly rivals premium aftermarket systems for clarity, 
            power and detail. This system can play program material from a wide range of sources. It plays conventional 
            CDs, discs encoded with MP3 or WMA files and DVD-audio discs. With hundreds of times the resolution of a normal 
            CD, DVD-audio allows for an astounding dynamic range and clarity. There is also an auxiliary mini-jack for use 
            with an external MP3 player and a USB Audio Interface7 for the connection of an iPod®8 or compatible MP3 player.
